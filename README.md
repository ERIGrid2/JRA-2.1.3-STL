# Benchmark Model Multi-Energy Networks STL

This repository contains a exemplary co-simulation scenario with a same time loop for initialization based on the [Benchmark Model Multi-Energy Networks] implementations of the multi-energy networks benchmark model developed in the [ERIGrid 2.0] project.

Python 3.8 is recommended for executing the scenario.
